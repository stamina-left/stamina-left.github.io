Let's say, for whatever reason, you found an app idea, and you want to build this app before you forgot the intention you have right now. To solve this problem, you should make a prototype. But, what's a prototype, and why do we bother to spend our time designing it?

Before we jump onto how to design a prototype, let's look at the first paragraph of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping" target="blank">the definition of software prototyping from Wikipedia</a>.

><b>Software prototyping</b> is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed. It is an activity that can occur in software development and is comparable to prototyping as known from other fields, such as mechanical engineering or manufacturing.

Now you may be questioning why we have to make an incomplete version of our product. The key is to define what you truly want to create, and when it comes to working with more than one person, a prototype will give them a clear idea of what app to build. 

A prototype will help you to remember what app you want to create. You can also see what kind of features you need to add to your app from the prototype.

You're probably thinking that using a fancy vector graphics editor like Sketch or Adobe Illustrator is the only way to create a prototype. No, you don't have to use those apps. You can also make it from your favorite IDE directly. In this example, I'm going to use an Xcode.

The first step of creating a prototype is by describing what does each page does. If your app idea is about watchlists of stocks, your first page shows a list of added stocks to the watchlist or system default watchlist if the user doesn't add any stocks.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/app-idea/xcode-watchlist.png">
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A table view controller and some edited cells.
</div>

You also had thought, where the next page will show up when the user picks one stock from the watchlist, presents current news about it. Repeat those steps until you satisfy your needs.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/app-idea/xcode-news.png">
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A modal table view controller and some edited cells.
</div>

If you knew how to perform the Behavior Driven Development principle, this helps you even more. Without consciousness, you also create a user story so that its purpose is related to business outcomes.

This benefit will not only for the developers but also the designers to design the app assets. If you also do a product design, you can use it to fail quickly and cheaply.

What do you think about the prototype? Was it helpful for you? Do you make a prototype for other purposes? I would love to know how you use it. Thank you for reading, and I'll see you in the future article.
