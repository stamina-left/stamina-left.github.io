Albert is a computer science graduate at the University of Surabaya (UBAYA) and currently looking for a challenging environment. He is skilled in iOS app development. Recently, he is also gaining experience in advanced iOS app development and clean architecture as an intern at [Apple Developer Academy @UC](https://appledeveloperacademy.uc.ac.id).

At Apple Developer Academy, he and his teams created their first app to help young adults dyslexic by giving accommodation when a dyslexic person read a book or document easily using their app, named [Readdy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/readdy-reading-assistant/id1526676332).
