Long story short, my friend and I made a solution for a young adult dyslexic to get a better reading experience. We've been list down questions, doing research, looking for the most impactful solution, and make a prototype of it.

Our app has three main features, an optical character reader, a screen reader, and text adjustments. The app isn't just limited to use by dyslexic people but also for people who had trouble at reading.
